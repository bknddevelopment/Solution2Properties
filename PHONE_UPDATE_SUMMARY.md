# Phone Number Update Summary

## Update Completed: January 16, 2025

### Phone Number Change
- **Previous**: (919) 555-0100
- **Current**: (252) 258-0913
- **Status**: ✅ All documentation updated

## What Was Updated

### 1. Source Code
- ✅ `/src/lib/constants.ts` - Already contains the correct phone number (252) 258-0913
- ✅ All components are properly importing from constants (no hardcoding found)

### 2. Documentation Files
- ✅ **LOCATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Updated 5 instances of old phone number
- ✅ **README.md** - Enhanced with comprehensive project information and new contact details
- ✅ **CONTACT_MANAGEMENT.md** - Created new comprehensive guide for contact information management
- ✅ **CHANGELOG.md** - Created to track this and future changes
- ✅ **PHONE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Implementation Quality

### ✅ Best Practices Already in Place
1. **Centralized Configuration**: All contact info is in `/src/lib/constants.ts`
2. **No Hardcoding**: All components import from constants
3. **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript const assertions
4. **Consistent Usage**: 10+ files properly using COMPANY_INFO.phone

### Code Pattern in Use
```typescript
// constants.ts
export const COMPANY_INFO = {
  phone: '(252) 258-0913',
  // ... other fields
} as const;

// Component usage
import { COMPANY_INFO } from '@/lib/constants';
<a href={`tel:${COMPANY_INFO.phone}`}>{COMPANY_INFO.phone}</a>
```

## Future-Proofing Recommendations

### 1. Automated Validation
Add ESLint rule to prevent hardcoding:
```javascript
'no-restricted-syntax': [
  'error',
  {
    selector: 'Literal[value=/\\(\\d{3}\\)\\s*\\d{3}-\\d{4}/]',
    message: 'Use COMPANY_INFO.phone from @/lib/constants'
  }
]
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Consider using environment variables for different environments:
```typescript
phone: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE || '(252) 258-0913'
```

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks
Add validation to prevent accidental hardcoding in git commits.

### 4. External Services Checklist
Remember to update:
- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] Social media profiles
- [ ] Email signatures
- [ ] CRM systems
- [ ] Call tracking services
- [ ] Marketing materials
- [ ] Domain WHOIS information
